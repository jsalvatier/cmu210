  exercise 3
  theorem a directed graph G = (V, E) has a cycle <-> a DFS of (V U {s}, E U {(s,v) : v in V}) contains a back edge

  proof 
    let G have a cycle then there's a path P that starts and ends at the same vertex, v 
    let b be the second vertex along P 
    v is reachable from b so b is v's ancestor
    v --> b so and b ancestor v so the first link is a back edge.
